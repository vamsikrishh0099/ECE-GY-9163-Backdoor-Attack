### Name: Vamsi Krishna Bunga
### Net ID: vb2279

## Objective
The main aim of this project is to come up with a implemention to fix the BadNet model. We're using pruning strategy. After we prune the model, we'll create another GoodNet model. This new model should correctly predict regular examples, find backdoored examples, and classify them separately as N+1 class.

All the code that I have written can be found in the vb2279_backdoor_attack.ipynb notebook file.

Please refer to backdoor_attacks_report.pdf for the report. 
It containts steps to run the code, my observations, results table and plots.
